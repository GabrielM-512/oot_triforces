# oot_triforces
All of us have burning questions. What is the meaning of life? How can we achieve happiness? How many Triforces are there in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time? Well, I answered one of those.

To use this project, simply download and execute main.py (or triforces.py if you're downloading from the release page). It will get the data from this repo automatically.

If you want to use this count in any way, a credit to me (Grootmaster47) would be appreciated :)

Apart from this, do with this project as you want to, as long as it is free of price for any users.
